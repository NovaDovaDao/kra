# Universal Service Business Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your project brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• Create a comprehensive SaaS platform that auto-generates custom branded landing pages with integrated booking, payments, and loyalty systems
• Enable service businesses to establish professional online presence with booking infrastructure in under 30 minutes
• Integrate Cal.com scheduling, Stripe payments, and Web3 tokenization into unified platform
• Achieve target of 500 active businesses within first year with 85% retention rate
• Generate $100K ARR within 12 months through subscription and transaction fees
• Provide industry-specific optimization templates for wellness, consulting, and professional services

### Background Context

The Universal Service Business Platform addresses a critical gap in the market where service business owners lack affordable, conversion-optimized web presence with integrated business operations. Current solutions force businesses to manage multiple disconnected tools (website builders, booking platforms, payment processors, loyalty programs), creating operational complexity and suboptimal customer experiences.

This platform combines the design capabilities of Webstudio, proven scheduling from Cal.com, reliable payments through Stripe Connect, and innovative tokenized loyalty systems to create a "Shopify for service businesses" - providing complete business infrastructure from simple business input while maintaining professional appearance and conversion optimization.
